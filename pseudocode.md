# Calculator

## Pseudocode

### User Interface =

0. Make a choice function for user to choose whether they want decimal places or not
1. Ask the user for two numbers they want to use
2. If the user input the wrong type of input ask to try again with only saying number inputs only
3. Then ask the user what operation they want to perform with the two selected numbers
4. Then ask the user if they want to try again if not a good bye message

### Code Interface =

##### Functions :

1. Functions that calculate multiplication1, division2, subtraction3, addition4 and modulus5 with two options of calculator so it includes modulus for non-decimal places
2. A input checking function(cin.ignore) that forces user to only use integer inputs
3. Two functions that asks for user's inputs numFirst && numSecond
4. A function that shows the equation
5. Make a choice function for user to choose whether they want decimal places or not

##### Int main () :

1. A presentation of what the program is used for
2. Ask user for two inputs number #1 and number #2
3. Then a list of options toward what operation they want to use
4. Show answer
5. Then the option to continue using program or exit

### Issue

1. Figuring out how to implement modulus into this program.
1. Solution = So I came up with the idea of having two separate calculators for whole numbers and decimal numbers
